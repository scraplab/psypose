- **Simple:** Simultaneously predicting the body center locations and corresponding 3D body mesh parameters for all people at each pixel.

- **Fast:** ROMP ResNet-50 model runs over *30* FPS on a 1070Ti GPU.

- **Strong**: ROMP achieves superior performance on multiple challenging multi-person/occlusion benchmarks, including 3DPW, CMU Panoptic, and 3DOH50K.

- **Easy to use:** We provide user friendly testing API and webcam demos. 

### News

### Try on Google Colab
Before installation, you can take a few minutes to try the prepared [Google Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oz9E6uIbj4udOPZvA1Zi9pFx0SWH_UXg#scrollTo=s8gFtokdcEQo) a try.  
It allows you to run the project in the cloud, free of charge. 

Please refer to the [bug.md](docs/bugs.md) for unpleasant bugs. Welcome to submit the issues for related bugs.

### Installation

Please refer to [install.md](docs/install.md) for installation.

### Demo

Currently, the released code is used to re-implement demo results. Only 1-2G GPU memory is needed.

To do this you just need to run
```bash
cd ROMP/src
sh run.sh
# if there are any bugs about shell script, please consider run the following command instead:
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python core/test.py --gpu=0 --configs_yml=configs/single_image.yml
```
Results will be saved in ROMP/demo/images_results.

#### Internet images
You can also run the code on random internet images via putting the images under ROMP/demo/images.

Please refer to [config_guide.md](docs/config_guide.md) for **saving the estimated mesh/Center maps/parameters dict**.

#### Internet videos

You can also run the code on random internet videos.

To do this you just need to firstly change the input_video_path in src/configs/video.yml to /path/to/your/video. For example, set

```bash
 video_or_frame: True
 input_video_path: '../demo/videos/sample_video.mp4' # None
 output_dir: '../demo/videos/sample_video_results/'
```
then run 

```bash
cd ROMP/src
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python core/test.py --gpu=0 --configs_yml=configs/video.yml
```
Results will be saved to `../demo/videos/sample_video_results`.

##### Export to Blender FBX 

<p float="center">
  <img src="../assets/demo/animation/fbx_animation.gif" width="50%" />
</p>

Please refer to [expert.md](docs/export.md) to export the results to fbx files for Blender usage. Currently, this function only support the single-person video cases. Therefore, please test it with `../demo/videos/sample_video2_results/sample_video2.mp4`, whose results would be saved to `../demo/videos/sample_video2_results`.

#### Webcam

We also provide the webcam demo code, which can run at real-time on a 1070Ti GPU / remote server.  
Currently, limited by the visualization pipeline, the webcam visulization code only support the single-person mesh.

To do this you just need to run
```bash
cd ROMP/src
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python core/test.py --gpu=0 --configs_yml=configs/webcam.yml
# or try to use the model with ResNet-50 as backbone.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python core/test.py --gpu=0 --configs_yml=configs/webcam_resnet.yml
```
Press Up/Down to end the demo. Pelease refer to [config_guide.md](docs/config_guide.md) for running webcam demo on remote server, setting mesh color or camera id.

### Evaluation

Please refer to [evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md) for evaluation on benchmarks.

## TODO LIST

The code will be gradually open sourced according to:
- [ ] the schedule
  - [x] demo code for internet images / videos / webcam
  - [x] runtime optimization
  - [x] benchmark evaluation
  - [ ] training
