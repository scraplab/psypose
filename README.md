# psypose
Tools for processing pose estimation for psychological research.

## Installation 
The easiest way to get started with PsyPose at this point is to install the ROMP branch (actively in development) using pip:
`pip install git+https://github.com/scraplab/psypose.git@psypose_ROMP`. \

*Note: Psypose requires some pre-trained model files - these will be downloaded automatically the first time psypose is imported, and they take up a couple gigs of space.
